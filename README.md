## Instructions


The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## Index file 

The file contains the skeleton of the web page, which has semantic styling  
Througout the body you will find four sections with 'lorem ipsum' text but it is of, as  we can
change it in the future to meaningful text
The use of `id` , `class` and `data-nav` attributes play important role in the stucture of the page


## App

The part where all logic happens. The goal of the file is to create dynamic navbar and keep track of 
active sections in the page which will be clearly visible with the help of add styling through `javascript` and plus using some arrow `=>` functions. Also the use of event listeners helps us to navigate throgh the page easily

## Styling 

Actually, most of the styling was provided by Udacity. This is a good things to take it in to account,as we see the use of professional styling and can learn something new and experience it.

## Launching
